            <p>
                I'm a recent graduate in Computer Science from the 
                University of Houston, passionate about exploring the 
                endless possibilities of data science and machine learning. 
                I have a strong foundation in full-stack development and 
                enjoy creating data-driven applications. Learning new 
                technologies and diving deep into code are what drive me!
